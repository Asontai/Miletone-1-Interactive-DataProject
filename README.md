# Miletone-1-Interactive-DataProject
REFLECTION

I am excited to share my reflection on my progress thus far in the project. At the beginning of the semester, I found it challenging to choose a topic for my project. However, after seeking guidance from Dr. Silva, I decided to focus on the US Tech industry, as it is a broad and interesting topic. The first milestone of gathering data and sources was time-consuming, but I am thrilled to have accomplished it.

As I move forward, I am eager to analyze the datasets I have collected and learn how to visualize them using Plotly. I am particularly interested in creating 2D or 3D plots to present the data in a more engaging and comprehensive way. While I am uncertain if I can achieve this goal, it is my intention to strive towards it.

Overall, I am excited about the potential of my project and the skills I will develop throughout the remainder of the semester. I am eager to continue exploring the US Tech industry, discovering new insights and findings, and presenting them in innovative and exciting ways.
